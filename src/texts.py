        In this project, I undertake the analysis of Airbnb listings across several major European cities. The data, obtained from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/), circumvents the challenges of accessing the Airbnb API directly and provides rich datasets for comprehensive analysis.

        The goal is to design and execute a complete data processing workflow. This includes the ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) operations for data curation, the development of dynamic visualizations using **Plotly**, and the construction of machine learning models aimed at predicting listing prices based on various attributes.

        I started with datasets from eight iconic cities: **Florence, Amsterdam, Brussels, Barcelona, Lisbon, Berlin, Paris, and London**. These datasets are well-suited for thorough data analysis and visualization tasks.

        The consolidation of these datasets resulted in a combined dataset with **17 features encompassing a total of 237,238 Airbnb listings**. Among these, the "name" feature, although seemingly unprocessed, revealed a treasure trove of insights.
